## Summary
I am an Economist at Compass Lexecon, a leading economic consulting firm.  In my eight years at Compass Lexecon, I have consulted well over thirty clients across more than ten industries in litigation and regulatory proceedings with multi-billion dollar outcomes.  As an economist with expertise in data science, I have provided written and/or oral testimony before the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority in matters pertaining to competition in the airline's industry and business data services in the telecommunications industry.  Over this time, I have developed and communicated results of complex analyses including regression models, DCF valuations, merger and regulatory analyses, and data processes to client stakeholders, their counsel, and the economic experts whom I support. I have over six years of experience managing teams of research and data analysts, as well as experience in leading training on software such as Stata, QGIS, and programming best practices.  

During my graduate studies at UC Berkeley's [MIDS program](https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/data-science/), I focused on the application of natural language processing (NLP) for text classification and the application of neural networks for solving classification problems in audio data.  I also completed coursework in experimental design and developing data pipelines at scale.  Outside of my consulting work, my research interests include the application of NLP for detecting bias and improving educational outcomes through policy analysis.
